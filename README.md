FYI: Proper GAIN config does not use ALL_min_profit =

```
#-----GAIN SETTINGS---------
 ALL_sell_strategy = GAIN
 ALL_sell_value = 0.6
 ALL_trailing_profit = 0.16
 
#-----HIGHBB SETTINGS--------

# ALL_sell_strategy =  HIGHBB
# ALL_sell_value = 25
# ALL_min_profit = 0.6
# ALL_trailing_profit = 0.25
```

# BB tips:

Setting included is for a relatively neutral to bullish market.

In bleeding, red, bearish markets:  try -10BB even -15BB 

To fine-tune dip buying levels and my preferred method while actively trading and tweaking everything in a slight BTC rise (also can be used in normal market) but it requires adjustments so you need to stay present ok or use a trailing buy and less tight /optimal settings, which still will profit but not at all times. 

-Set a trailing buy and enable SOM  
-Now check if true pairs pop up, and dial down bit by bit even possibly as low as -20 until there are only 1 or 2 at a time this is how you check where the dips are at.

[When tuned tight and optimally for the lowest buys at the current market condition: ]

-DISABLE Trailing Buy this way, now you buy the coins when they enter that low area while if you use  trailing buy you wait for someone to snatch it away in front of your sorry ass face. ;)
- Now disable SOM, so buys will and trading will start

(This varies with BTC price, Tip: open up a tradingview window with USDBTC (picture included)
When it starts rising you can set it lower when it drops adjust a bit higher.

Sometimes you can stay at the same buy setting for 2 hours but this might change instantly the visual gives you a good indication, for you to act on, in case the market shifts..
When ALTS start to rise the included default settings with enablebled trailing buy are pretty safe and less maintenance is required. 

(On the other alts rising like crazy side: higher BB levels like 45 can be optimal.)
